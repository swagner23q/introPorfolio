Hello! My name is Sara Wagner and this is my first code review with the school Epicodus in the city of Portland. 
This project is the beginning of a github portfolio utilizing what I have learned o=in my first week of code school.
The languages I used to create this webpage are HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and Javascript.
Atom and the Teminal applications were used to edit this project.
