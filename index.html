          <p>Hello! Konichi wa! I am <strong>Sara Wagner</strong>, and this is my first website utilizing all of my lessons of week one with Epicodus. Browse around, have an adventure with the mouse and click to your heart's desire.</p>

          <h2>Week One: Html Basics and Bootstrap</h2>
          <p>This week at Epicodus, our lessons taught us the basics and then we began to learn how to utilize Boostrap. At first, it was quite intimidating as we went through the beginning steps while following along to video tutorials from Treehouse. After the videos, my partner and I actually ended up going through the videos step by step. It was incredibly satisfying to complete each step at our own pace and watch the changes we made. Soon after, once we finished setting up the website with the basic layout, we began to customize. Customizing is always the best part of creating a website, the possibilities are infinite!</p>

            <p>Hello! Let me tell you a little about myself and the kind of person I am. I love to laugh, it sounds cheesy, but in times of all seriousness, you need a little bit of comic relief in your life to relax. I'm am what you would call a laid back personality, and very accepting of each other's beliefs and ways of life. I'm incredibly loyal, once you're locked in, I won't let you go. I like to think myself as a free spirit as well, mostly going with the flow of events but I do find comfort in organized schedules. I am in love with the tech industry and cannot get enough of it. I'm basically from the Portland metro area and couldn't possibly stay away after moving to Arizona and then Seattle, WA. I guess I'll be a hipster for life!</p>

          <h4>School</h4>
          <p>While I was attending grade school, I was able to take a graphic design and web design class. At the time, it was editing in notepad mostly and using Dreamweaver. It was a ton of fun, and I had already taken upon myself to teach myself the fundamentals of HTML and troubleshoot Javascript. Although I began to immerse myself in the tech field, I ended up pursuing a degree in Japanese Language. My love for the aesthetics of the Japanese language at the time became a huge passion. I attended Clark Community College in Vancouver, WA and transferred to the University of Washington in Seattle, WA. I graduated in 2012 with a degree of Arts, majoring in Asia Studies: Japan, and minoring in the Japanese Language. I was soon headed to an English teaching job in Japan, but sadly, ended up with cold feet. Years later, I decided to attend Epicodus in efforts to become a Junior Developer.</p>

          <h4>Passions</h4>
          I absolutely love to play video games and watch anime. Growing up in the suburbs, especially in the Northwest, didn't leave much to most the time. As a kid, I found myself mostly outdoors when I wasn't riding my bicycle or at a friend's house. My brother, Steve, had always been into video games so I grew up playing Street Fighter, Sonic the Hedgehog, Ecco the Dolphin etc. I fell deep into the Playstation game Final Fantasy VII and loved playing Square-Enix games since. I fell in love with anime when Cartoon Network started their program Toonami which had a few shows to start like Sailor Moon, Dragon Ball Z, and Cowboy Bebop. Sine then I've never stop watching. I've probably seen all of the ones worth mentioning, and there is quite a lot! The scene is ever growing, and because of anime, I began learning HTML/CSS to start a website based off an anime show and eventually pursued the Japanese Language through college.

          <h4>Experience</h4>
          My experience through work life has mostly been in the food industry and has been a ten year journey. I've been a waitress, server, and barista. Most of the career through the food service has been as a barista and my final position was with Bon Appetit Management Company. I did enjoy for a period of time not having to take the work home with me. My jobs have always been a means to surviving. Being an agent in the customer service field has given my many experiences and has definitely aided in my personal and professional growth. Having to handle people, good or bad, on a daily basis has taught me patience. I also have developed keen interpersonal skills that has enabled me to provide excellent service even under pressure. I don't regret any of my time in the industry. I've met so many amazing people, even my significant other, and have been able to develop close bonds. I think paired with programming, I'll be able to excel in acute and transparent communication between team members and help me transition easily.

            <h3>Why I Chose Programming</h3>
            <p><img src="images/pikachu.gif"></p>
            <div class="quote">
              <br><em><strong>"Think of programming as a rubberband ball. Then you just keep adding to it more and more, and soon you have this massive rubberband ball of knowledge."</br>
              <p>-Angelko Krstanovic, Software Engineer @Innovation Force</strong></em></p>
            </div>
            <p>I chose programming because it has always been a passion of mine ever since I started to dive in through the years. I was able to open a source on a webpage and immediately find a specific code that I wanted to use for myself. Even when I was tinkering around with AOL Instant Messenger profiles, I created and customized for hours. I'd spend so much time playing with desktop UIs, such as the Enigma application. I've always felt like programming was something I could naturally do and figure out for hours. I'd be so determined to be 100% positive on a fix I would do to either a website or desktop interface. When I was younger, I had felt like if I pursued a career on a computer, I would be sitting down the rest of my life. Now, I see that no matter what pathway I try, it always comes back to programming.</p>
